    "description": "A blood test usually involves taking a blood sample from a blood vessel in your arm. The arm is a convenient part of the body to use because it can be easily uncovered.The usual place for a sample to be taken from is the ins_ide of the elbow or wrist, where the veins are relatively close to the surface. Blood samples from children are often taken from the back of the hand. Their skin may be numbed with a special spray or cream before the sample is taken."
